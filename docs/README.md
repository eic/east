Please see the "contribute for this site" for instructions on editing and
running Jekyll (if necesary).

Jekyll invocation (the port needs to be defined only if the default one -- 4000 --
is blocked by the system which may happen on WSL2)

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
